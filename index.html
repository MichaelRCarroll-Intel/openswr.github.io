<p>The purpose of OpenSWR is to provide a high performance, highly
scalable OpenGL compatible software rasterizer that allows use of
unmodified visualization software.  This allows working with datasets
where GPU hardware isn't available or is limiting.  OpenSWR is
completely CPU-based, and runs on anything from laptops, to
workstations, to compute nodes in HPC systems.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">Click either image for more information</p>

<p>OpenSWR internally builds on top of LLVM, and fully utilizes modern
instruction sets like Intel<sup>&copy;</sup> SSE, AVX, or AVX2 to achieve high
rendering performance.</p>

<p>OpenSWR builds a libGL.so which is a drop-in replacement for the
systems OpenGL library.  No recompilation of your programs is
neccessary -- just set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD to point to the
directory or library and run your program as you normally would.</p>

<p>We also provide the OSMesa API for offscreen rendering if that
better suits your needs.  There is one addition to the api, <tt>void
OSMesaFinishSWR(void)</tt>, which needs to be called to flush
rendering to the memory buffer.</p>

<p>ALPHA release.  This version is the first to be released to the public.  Please bear
with us if there are build or functionality issues.  The major
applications used for testing were ParaView and VisIt - if you are
trying another program you may encounter missing features.</p>

<p>This version is coming out as we are working on some major cleanups to
the code.  In order to keep our commitment to release this to the
community and to provide a well-tested version, we are releasing the
code that was used for the SC14 demonstrations.  The next major
release will contain the cleanups.</p>

<p>The source code can be downloaded from here:
