            Overview
        </h3>

<p>The purpose of OpenSWR is to provide a high performance, highly
scalable OpenGL compatible software rasterizer that allows use of
unmodified visualization software.  This allows working with datasets
where GPU hardware isn't available or is limiting.  OpenSWR is
completely CPU-based, and runs on anything from laptops, to
workstations, to compute nodes in HPC systems.</p>

<p>OpenSWR internally builds on top of LLVM, and fully utilizes modern
instruction sets like Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), and
Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX and AVX2) to achieve high
rendering performance.  The charts below illustrate the compelling advantage of
OpenSWR over Mesa llvmpipe in a real application.</p>

<p> We are working on integrating both the SWR core and driver into the Mesa
project.  This will provide a SWR renderer that supports much of the OpenGL 3.3
Core and OpenGL 3.0 Compatibility contexts.</p>

<p>As with our original version of OpenSWR, this is a drop-in replacement OpenGL
library - no recompilation of your programs is necessary.</p>

<p>Our initial public version of our Mesa+SWR integration work is now available from <a href="https://github.com/OpenSWR/openswr-mesa">https://github.com/OpenSWR/openswr-mesa</a>.</p>

<p> Since the release of early alpha, we have been busy integrating our OpenSWR
core into the Mesa project.  This enables us to take advantage of a very
mature, very feature complete driver stack that would have been very difficult
to develop on our own.</p>
<p> The result is that OpenSWR now has far greater functionality than the OpenGL
1.4 features available in the first alpha release.</p>

<p>ALPHA release.  This version is the first to be released to the public.  Please bear
with us if there are build or functionality issues.  The major
applications used for testing were ParaView and VisIt - if you are
trying another program you may encounter missing features.</p>

<p>This version is coming out as we are working on some major cleanups to
the code.  In order to keep our commitment to release this to the
community and to provide a well-tested version, we are releasing the
code that was used for the SC14 demonstrations.  The next major
release will contain the cleanups.</p>

<p>The source code can be downloaded from here:
